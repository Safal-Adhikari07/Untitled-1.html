        <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> I come from a strong background in science and biology. Initially, I pursued biology with the misconception that it would provide greater academic flexibility, allowing me to transition into engineering during my bachelor's studies. However, over time, I realized the immense significance of computer science and its impact on the modern world. Recognizing my true passion for software development, I am now determined to bridge this gap and fully immerse myself in the field. I plan to pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Software Engineering, with a strong aspiration to study in the United States. The US offers unparalleled access to cutting-edge technology, advanced research, and a thriving innovation ecosystem. While I believe I can become a skilled software engineer through dedicated learning, studying in the US will provide the best platform to refine my expertise and excel in the industry. My ultimate goal is to revolutionize Nepal's software infrastructure and establish myself as a leading Nepali software engineer. With the advanced knowledge and experience I will gain, I aim to build my own tech empire, driving innovation and contributing to Nepal’s technological advancement. </p>
       <h2>Purpose Of This Website</h2>
        <p>I have just received the Legion 5 16IRX9 as a gift from my brother and sister on March 5. I feel incredibly lucky and blessed to have such wonderful siblings. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to my brother and my sisters for this amazing gift. Their support and love mean the world to me, and this gift will help me in my journey to become a successful software engineer.</p>
        <p>I also want to thank my parents for their unwavering support in every step I decide to take. Their encouragement and belief in me have been a constant source of strength and motivation. I am truly grateful for their love and guidance.</p>
